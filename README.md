I remember when I was 7 years old, my mother took my brother and I to see ‘The National Museum of Rio de Janeiro’ (Brazil). I remember coming home and being unable to fall asleep at night with all that overload of information in my head. I also remember feeling sorry we went there for just one day! It was simply not enough. I wanted more time to see the objects from close and observe each detail. After that day, every time we would visit my grand-parents in Rio de Janeiro, we would drive my mother nuts, trying to convince her to take us to the museum again. 
Fast forwarding 30 years, one day I started to get a bunch of ‘Whatsapp’ messages from my relatives in Brazil, containing videos of a horrible fire… and the fire… was at my favourite museum ever. I felt a mixture of feelings, from sadness to anger as I just could not accept that we had lost an entire museum due to administrative negligence. Apparently, the fire safety certificate was expired since 2014.
Thus, when I started to ponder upon the possibility of digitalizing museum collections, the first thought that came to my mind was: my favourite museum could have been saved at least from a ‘digital’ perspective. It had a collection of almost 20 million artifacts that had been collected in a period of 200 years. 
Information technology comes as a tool to preserve, at least digitally, so many precious confections from the past. It also facilitates the collection, analysis and visualization of artifacts; and helps in terms of public participation and even training methods.
Moreover, it is valid to remember how technology facilitates the democratization of archaeology as a discipline among communities, where people who would never have had a chance to be exposed to such field, end up being able to do so. Furthermore, digital collections can be an excellent tool for educators, specially now under this post-Covid era where ‘in person field trips’ are becoming extremely challenging to be arranged. 
Therefore, I would like to explore the 3 following readings:

Trofanko, Brenda. 2014.“Reconsidering the Educational Promise of Public History Exhibits” in K. Kee, ed. Pastplay. https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv65swr0.16

The first reading will be addressing how we store collections. The second reading will be dealing with challenges we face when it comes to digitalizing collections. And the third one will be covering the benefits of museum digitalization for the educational arena. Please note, I am opened to suggestions!
